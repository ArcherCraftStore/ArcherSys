CHANGE LOG
---------------------------
v1.0 - 10 Feb 2010: Initial release

v1.1 - 10 Feb 2010:
  -- Corrections to string conversion from telnet
  -- SocketClients buffer data from socket until appropriate end-of-line
  -- Client interface now allows sending CRs alone, don't wrap new msgs
     to prevent breaking long strings

v1.2 - 11 Feb 2010:
  -- Massive cleanup and conversion on WebSocket client connection handling
     in the server
  -- Cleaner handling of normal spaces in Telnet cleanup function
  -- Added Creative Commons 3.0 license to all source

v1.21 - 20 Feb 2010:
  -- Marginal MXP support is in
  -- Correction to buffering in MUD connection, no longer breaks lines
  -- Correction to telnet color/general code handling -- hopefully all fixed
  -- Many, many various little fixes

v1.22 - 18 Apr 2010:
  -- Fix for end-of-line recognition (server continued to wait for data from game 
     incorrectly)
  -- Back-in-action: have internet, house, and job; time to play!

v1.3 - 13 Jun 2010:
  -- Flex client fallback for browsers that don't support WebSockets in place (means 
     that IE and Firefox users can now play)
	--- NOTE: The file "crossdomain.xml" should be placed in the root folder 
	    of your webserver!
  -- Major update to sample interface (DIV based layout, corrected scrollback recognition)
  -- Marginal ATCP support added (not implemented in demo client, but server will negotiate 
     ATCP option; check the console in an ATCP-enabled game (any Iron Realms Entertainment game) 
     for examples).

v1.31 - 27 Jun 2010:
  -- Major swap of Flex client handling -- found an excellent resource at:
	http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js
     that provides "native" WebSocket handling to Firefox/IE/etc.
  -- Major fix to PHP WebSocket handshake functionality -- found another excellent resource at:
	http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2010/06/websocket-handshake-76-simplified.html
     with updated handler for new security protocols.

v1.32 - 27 Jun 2010:
  -- Sorry bout that -- fixed a few more bugs and improved various client mechanics
