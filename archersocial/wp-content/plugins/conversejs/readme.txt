Converse.js is an open source webchat client, that runs in the browser and can be integrated into any website.

It's similar to Facebook chat, but also supports multi-user chatrooms.

Converse.js can connect to any accessible XMPP/Jabber server, either from a public provider such as jabber.org, or to one you have set up yourself.
