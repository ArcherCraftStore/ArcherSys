to the user profile.

include OAuth2 and LDAP (v0.5 of the LDAP plugin is required)

from whom you receive tickets. Staff can also manually register users and
even set an initial password. Users can also be imported and exported via

items can also be disabled now, which causes them to be hidden from
selection.

osTicket v1.8.1 (Preview)
=========================
### Collaborator Support (CC)
In addition to the ticket owner, other end users can be collaborators on a
ticket. Responses received from them are integrated automatically into the
ticket thread, and emails are sent to all collaborators when new messages and
responses arrive into the system. All collaborators have access to the ticket
via the client portal and are able to log new messages.

### Plugin management system
osTicket supports plugins via a (currently undocumented) simple plugin API and
interface. Plugins can be written and distributed as files or unpacked via ZIP
archives, or distributed via PHP PHAR files. The plugin system is developed in
hopes of adding extensibility to osTicket without significant overhead.
Initially, two "classes" of plugins are supported: authentication, and file
storage.

### Pluggable authentication
Staff members can now be authenticated against a backend other than the
osTicket internal database. Available immediately is integration with LDAP
(RFC-2307) and MicrosoftÂ® Active Directory. The initial authentication system
also support user lookups, so when browsing for new users when creating
tickets, your directory server will be queried for users and email addresses.

### Pluggable attachment storage
Attachments can live outside the database again. You can now write or install a
plugin to store your attachments somewhere other than in your database, and
osTicket will use the backend to store and retrieve (or redirect to) your
attachments. We've initially made a plugin available to store attachments on
the filesystem and plan on adding an Amazon S3 plugin very soon.

### Internationalization, Phase 1
Select your default data on installation, and select the language preference,
as a staff member, for the help tips. You can also now select the language of
the email templates when creating a new template. The templates for that
language will be used instead of the English ones where translated versions are
available.

  * Rich text ticket thread (#5)
  * Custom forms and fields (#2)
  * Translatable initial data *almost*

### Rich Text Ticket Thread
As an option, enabled by default, osTicket can now process HTML email and
allows for rich text markup in most long-answer boxes across the system,
including staff replies and internal notes posted to the ticket thread. To keep
the feature consistent throughout, canned responses and email templates also
sport an HTML theme now.

### Custom Forms and Fields
The data collected from your users when they fill out the ticket form is now
customizable. You can now ask any information relevant to your business
practice, and can customize the type of input show from the user. Currently,
short and long answer fields, drop-down lists, checkboxes, date and time, and
phone number fields are available. Each field is configurable and can be setup
according to your liking. Fields can also be marked as required, whose input is
required to submit the ticket, and internal, whose input is not visible to the
end user.

New Features in 1.7
===================
Version 1.7 includes several new features

Ticket Filters
-------------
As an upgrade from email banning (which is still supported), ticket filters
allow for matching incoming email in the subject line and message body. For
matching emails, the administrator has the ability to automatically route
tickets:

  * To a specific department, staff member, and/or team
  * Automatically assign ticket priority and/or service-level-agreement
  * Disable ticket auto-responses
  * Send automatic canned responses

Tickets filters are also applied to tickets submitted via all ticket
interfaces, including the API, email, staff and client web interfaces. And,
as a bonus, the filters can be configured to target only a single interface.
So an administrator could, for instance, target tickets received via email
from a particular domain.

Canned Attachments
------------------
Attach files to your canned responses. These attachments are automatically
attached to the ticket thread along with the canned response. The
attachments are not duplicated in the database and therefore use virtually
no space.

Database-backed Attachments
---------------------------
No more crazy security-related configuration to your host server in order to
support attachments. Attachments are now quietly stored in the database. The
upgrade migration will automatically port attachments from the previous
locations into the database.

Service Level Agreements
------------------------
Service level agreements allow for a configurable grace period based on the
department or help topic associated with the ticket. A default SLA is
provided, and a due date can be set to override the grace period of the SLA
for a ticket.

Client-side Knowledgebase
-------------------------
Manage a searchable help document portal for your users

Dashboard Reports
-----------------
Flashy reports of ticket system activity as well as exportable ticket system
statistics, allowing for easy report generation from office spreadsheet
applications.

Ticket Export
-------------
Convert the ticket thread to a printed format for long term storage. The
ticket view page now supports a print feature, which will render the ticket
as a PDF document.

API
---
Interface with osTicket via HTTP requests. Starting with version 1.7,
tickets are createable by submitting an HTTP POST request to either

    /api/tickets.xml
    /api/tickets.json

The API can also be used to pipe emails into the osTicket system. Use the
included `automail.php` or `automail.pl` script to pipe emails to the
system, or post raw email messages directly to

    /api/tickets.email

Use of the API requires an API key, which can be created and configured in
the admin panel of the support system.

For technical details, please refer to [API Docs] (setup/doc/api.md).

Geeky New Features
==================

Unicode
-------
Better and more consistent international text handling

Flexible Template Variables
---------------------------
Template variables have been redesigned to be more flexible. They have been
integrated into the respective object classes so that an object as well as
its properties can be represented in template variables. For instance
%{ticket.staff.name}
