The Composer Asset Plugin allows you to manage project assets (css, js, etc.) in your `composer.json`
without installing NPM or Bower.

This plugin works by transposing package information from NPM or Bower to a compatible version for Composer.
This allows you to manage asset dependencies in a PHP based project very easily.

> **Warning!**
>
> Currently the plugin only works in "global" mode, the PR [#3082](https://github.com/composer/composer/pull/3082)
> will allow the plugin to work in "project" mode

  - [Bower Registry](http://bower.io/search)
- Automatically get and create the Asset VCS repositories of dependencies defined
  in each asset package (dev dependencies included)
- Mapping conversion of asset package to composer package for:
  - [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/package.json.html) - [package.json](Resources/doc/schema.md#npm-mapping)
  - [Bower Package](http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages) - [bower.json](Resources/doc/schema.md#bower-mapping)

- Conversion of [dependencies with URL](Resources/doc/schema.md#url-range-verison-conversion) to the composer dependencies with the creation of VCS repositories
- Conversion of [multiple versions of the same dependency](Resources/doc/schema.md#multiple-version-of-depdendency-in-the-same-project) to different dependencies of composer
- Add manually the [multiple versions of a same dependency in the project](Resources/doc/index.md#usage-with-multiple-version-of-a-same-dependency)
- Add a [custom config of VCS Repository](Resources/doc/index.md#usage-with-vcs-repository)

##### Why this plugin?

There already are several possibilities for managing assets in a PHP project:

1. Install Node.js and use NPM or Bower command line in addition to Composer command line
2. Do #1, but add Composer scripts to automate the process
3. Include assets directly in the project (not recommended)
4. Create a repository with all assets and include the `composer.json` file (and use Packagist or an VCS Repository)
5. Add a package repository in `composer.json` with a direct download link
6. Create a Satis or Packagist server
7. Other?

It goes without saying that each javascript, CSS, etc. library should be developed with the usual tools for that
language, which front-end developers know well. However, in the case of a complete project in PHP, it shouldn't 
be necessary to use several tools (PHP, Nodejs, Composer, NPM, Bower, Grunt, etc.) to simply install
these assets in your project.

This plugin has been created to address these issues. Additionally, most developers will not add a `composer.json`
file to their projects just to support php based projects, especially when npm and/or bower already exist and are
widely used.
