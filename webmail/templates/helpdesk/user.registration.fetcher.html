:SUBJECT: {{HELPDESK_SITE_NAME}} Registration
<br />
Someone (most likely, you) has sent an e-mail from {{USER_EMAIL}} address to the monitored Helpdesk account {{FROM_EMAIL}}
Your e-mail address is not yet registered in Helpdesk system. As a result, your Helpdesk account will be provisioned automatically,
with the credentials below.
<br />
<br />
Username: {{USER_EMAIL}}
<br />
Password: {{USER_PASSWORD}}
<br />
<br />
If it was you who sent the e-mail to the Helpdesk, please follow this link to finish your registration:
<br />
{{ACTIVATION_LINK}}
<br />
<br />
Once done, you can access Helpdesk at {{HELPDESK_LINK}}. There, you can change your auto-generated password as well.
<br />
<br />
If you didn't send any e-mails to {{FROM_EMAIL}} recently and believe this message is an error, you can disregard this e-mail.
No account will be created and you'll not receive further e-mails from this address.
